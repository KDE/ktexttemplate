About KTextTemplate
-------------------

KTextTemplate is a set of Free Software libraries written using the [Qt framework](http://code.qt.io).
Currently two libraries are shipped with KTextTemplate: KTextTemplate Templates and KTextTemplate
TextDocument.

The goal of KTextTemplate Templates is to make it easier for application developers to
separate the structure of documents from the data they contain, opening the door
for theming and advanced generation of other text such as code.

The syntax uses the syntax of the [Django template system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/language/), and
the core design of Django is reused in KTextTemplate.

    <ul>
    {% for athlete in athlete_list %}
    <li>{{ athlete.name }}{% if athlete.isCaptain %} (C){% endif %}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

Part of the design of both template systems is that application developers can
extend the syntax by implementing their own tags and filters. For details of how
to do that, see the [API documentation](http://www.kde.org/apidox/extension.html).
